Florence and Tuscany: A Comprehensive Cultural & Logistical Dossier for the Remote Professional (February 7–27, 2026)
1. Executive Summary: The Florentine Residency
This dossier serves as a strategic blueprint for a twenty-day residency in Florence, Italy, scheduled from February 7 to February 27, 2026. Designed for a discerning traveler balancing professional remote work obligations with a profound cultural immersion, this report moves beyond the superficiality of standard tourism. Instead, it offers a granular analysis of the Oltrarno district—specifically the San Frediano neighborhood—and provides a rigorously vetted itinerary that harmonizes the 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM work schedule with the rich offerings of Tuscan life.
The itinerary is anchored by confirmed accommodation data: a transitional one-night stay at San Pier Novello in Oltrarno (Via Romana 26) on February 8, followed by a long-term residency at Via dell'Orto 31 from February 9 through February 27. This specific geography places you in the heart of the "Diladdarno" (the other side of the Arno), a historic enclave of artisans, antiques, and authentic Florentine nightlife that Lonely Planet has cited as one of the coolest neighborhoods in the world.
1.1 The February Advantage
Traveling in February 2026 offers a distinct strategic advantage. As a "shoulder season" month, it provides a respite from the overtourism that plagues Florence in the summer.
* Atmospheric Depth: The winter light in Tuscany is stark and dramatic, ideal for photography and experiencing the architectural gravitas of the city without the distraction of crowds.
* Cultural alignment: The trip coincides with the Carnevale di Viareggio, one of Europe's most significant satirical festivals. The 2026 schedule aligns perfectly with your weekends, offering opportunities to witness the colossal papier-mâché floats on February 7, 12, 15, 17, and 21.
* Culinary Seasonality: This is the season of cucina povera at its finest—hearty ribollita soups, cavolo nero (black kale), and rich game ragùs that define the Florentine winter table.
1.2 The Remote Work Paradigm
The constraints of a 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM work block necessitate a complete restructuring of the typical travel day. This dossier reorients the daily rhythm:
* The "Morning Cultural Block": 9:00 AM – 1:00 PM is dedicated to high-value cultural consumption (museums, churches, walking tours).
* The "Pranzo" (Lunch) Focus: In Italy, lunch is traditionally the main meal. This aligns perfectly with your schedule, allowing for leisurely, high-quality dining experiences between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM, a time when kitchens are firing on all cylinders.
* The "Aperitivo" Gap: The hours of 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM constitute your work phase. Logistics for connectivity, grocery provisioning, and workspace ergonomics at Via dell'Orto are analyzed below.
* The "Notte" (Night) Social: Post-10:00 PM dining in Florence is viable but requires insider knowledge. The Oltrarno is the city's nightlife capital, ensuring that your post-work hours remain vibrant.
2. Neighborhood Intelligence: San Frediano & The Oltrarno
Your base of operations, Via dell'Orto, serves as the central artery of the San Frediano district. To understand your temporary home is to understand the soul of modern Florence.
2.1 Historical Context and Atmosphere
Historically, the Oltrarno was the working-class quarter, separated from the centers of political power (Palazzo Vecchio) and religious power (the Duomo) by the Arno River. It was the domain of the ciompi (wool workers), artisans, and revolutionaries. Even after the Medici family moved their residence to the Pitti Palace in 1550, gentrifying the main thoroughfares like Via Maggio, the backstreets of San Frediano retained a gritty, authentic character.
Today, San Frediano is a paradoxical blend of the ancient and the hyper-contemporary. You will walk past workshops that have been restoring furniture for three centuries, sitting adjacent to cocktail bars serving molecular mixology. The atmosphere is less "museum" and more "living city." The locals here—proud Sanfredianini—maintain a distinct identity, often claiming to be the only "true" Florentines left.
2.2 Street-Level Analysis: Via dell'Orto
Your specific address, Via dell'Orto 31, places you in a strategic nexus.
* Westward: The street leads toward Porta San Frediano, a massive 14th-century gate that marks the old city walls.
* Eastward: It flows toward Piazza Tasso and Piazza del Carmine, home to the Brancacci Chapel.
* Immediate Vicinity: The street itself is a culinary destination, hosting renowned establishments like Trattoria dell'Orto and Il Guscio.
2.3 The Artisan Ecosystem
The Oltrarno is the last bastion of the Florentine bottega. Unlike the souvenir stalls of the city center, these are functional workshops.
* Leather: While the Scuola del Cuoio is across the river near Santa Croce, the Oltrarno houses masters like Mannina (Via de' Guicciardini) for bespoke shoes and Dimitri Villoresi for hand-stitched travel accessories.
* Paper: On Via Maggio and surrounding lanes, you will find masters of carta marmorizzata (marbled paper), a craft brought to Florence in the 17th century.
* Mosaics: The tradition of commesso fiorentino (Florentine mosaic in semi-precious stones) survives in small studios here, a direct lineage from the Medici workshops.
3. Logistical & Operational Framework
3.1 Arrival and Accommodation Transfer
* Phase 1: Arrival (Feb 7/8): Your booking at San Pier Novello (Via Romana 26) covers the night of Sunday, February 8. If you arrive on Feb 7 as per your prompt, you will need an interim solution for one night, or perhaps the "start" date refers to travel. Assuming arrival on Feb 8 for the confirmed booking:
   * San Pier Novello is located on Via Romana, the historic road leading south out of the city. It is approximately a 10-15 minute walk (850 meters) from your subsequent Airbnb.
* Phase 2: Relocation (Feb 9): Your check-in at Via dell'Orto 31 is on Monday, February 9 after 3:00 PM.
   * The Move: The transfer is easily walkable with light luggage. From Via Romana, you cross through the Piazza Santo Spirito or skirt the Boboli Gardens walls to reach Via dell'Orto.
   * Luggage Storage: If there is a gap between the 10:00 AM checkout at San Pier Novello and the 3:00 PM check-in, utilize luggage storage services (e.g., Stow Your Bags or Radical Storage) which have locations near Piazza Santo Spirito, or ask the San Pier Novello host to hold bags.
3.2 Connectivity and Remote Work Setup
Reliable internet is non-negotiable for your 5-10 PM shift.
* Primary Internet: Italian residential fiber is generally fast (FTTH), but Airbnbs can vary. Immediately upon check-in at Via dell'Orto, run a speed test.
* Backup Connectivity: Italy has excellent 4G/5G coverage. It is highly recommended to purchase a local SIM card (TIM or Vodafone offer the best coverage in stone buildings) with a high data cap (e.g., 50GB-100GB) to serve as a hotspot backup.
* Coworking Alternatives: If the apartment proves unsuitable for focus:
   * La Cité (Borgo San Frediano 20): A culturally significant bookshop-café just minutes from your door. It attracts a laptop-wielding crowd during the day, though it transitions to a bar/jazz vibe in the evening.
   * The Social Hub (formerly Student Hotel): Located on Viale Lavagnini (north of the station), this offers professional coworking day passes but requires a commute (25 min bus/walk).
   * Ditta Artigianale (Via dello Sprone 5R): Located in the Oltrarno, this "third wave" coffee shop is extremely laptop-friendly during the day, with reliable wifi and power outlets, rare for Italian cafes.
3.3 Transportation Logistics
* Trains: The primary hub is Firenze Santa Maria Novella (SMN).
   * Regional Trains: Used for Pisa, Lucca, Viareggio. Tickets (approx. €8-11) are fixed price and do not sell out. Crucial: Physical tickets must be validated in the green/yellow machines before boarding. Digital tickets via the Trenitalia app must be "checked in" prior to departure.
   * High Speed (Frecce/Italo): Used for Bologna, Rome, Milan. Prices rise closer to the date. Booking in advance is recommended. Seats are assigned.
* Buses: Autolinee Toscane operates city and regional buses. Tickets can be bought via the "at bus" app or at "Tabacchi" shops. The bus is the preferred method for reaching Siena.
4. Gastronomic Strategy: The "Workcation" Diet
Your schedule (Work 5-10 PM) inverts the standard tourist dining habits. You will adopt a "Lunch as Dinner" philosophy.
4.1 The Weekday Power Lunch (1:00 PM – 3:00 PM)
This is your golden hour. While tourists are snacking, you will enjoy full service.
* Trattoria dell'Orto (Via dell'Orto 35A): Your "local." Famous for pappardelle al cinghiale (wild boar) and a welcoming, unpretentious vibe. It is literally next door.
* Trattoria Sabatino (Via Pisana 2r): A legendary institution near Porta San Frediano. It defines "cheap eats" without sacrificing soul. Expect white tablecloths, shared tables, and a bill that rarely exceeds €15-20 for a full meal. A true relic of old Florence.
* I' Brindellone (Piazza Piattellina 10): A shrine to the Bistecca alla Fiorentina. It is rustic, adorned with Calcio Storico memorabilia, and serves one of the best value steaks in the city. Lunch here is a boisterous affair.
* Alla Vecchia Bettola (Viale Vasco Pratolini 3): Located on Piazza Tasso. Known for its penne alla bettola (vodka sauce pasta) and communal seating. High energy and very authentic.
4.2 The Late-Night Post-Work Dinner (10:00 PM+)
Finding food after 10 PM in Italy can be tricky, but the Oltrarno is the nightlife hub.
* Osteria Santo Spirito (Piazza Santo Spirito 16R): Open until 11:30 PM. This is the definitive late-night spot. Famous for truffle gnocchi served in sizzling terracotta pots. The piazza is alive well past midnight.
* Il Santino (Via di Santo Spirito 60R): A gastronomic wine bar. Perfect for a post-work glass of Chianti Classico and a platter of artisan cheeses and cured meats. It’s sophisticated, intimate, and open late.
* Gusta Pizza (Via Maggio 46R): Ideally eaten earlier, but often bustling. If open late, it’s the best Neapolitan pizza in the district.
* Berberè Pizza (Piazza de' Nerli): Famous for sourdough pizza, often open until 11:00 PM or later on weekends.
5. Week 1: Acclimatization & The Carnival (Feb 7 – Feb 15)
Context: The first week is about settling into the rhythm of the neighborhood, ensuring work connectivity, and experiencing the first major cultural events.
Saturday, Feb 7: Arrival
* Logistics: Arrive in Florence. Transfer to the Oltrarno. Since your Booking.com reservation at San Pier Novello starts Feb 8, ensure you have accommodations for this night or adjust arrival. (Assuming arrival Feb 7 and a gap night or adjustment).
* Activity: Evening stroll along the Lungarno Soderini. The view of the Corsini Palace across the river is spectacular.
* Dinner: Trattoria La Casalinga (Via dei Michelozzi 9R). A bustling, no-nonsense institution. Reservations essential. Try the bollito misto (boiled meats) or ribollita.
Sunday, Feb 8: Oltrarno Immersion
* Accommodation: Check-in at San Pier Novello (Via Romana 26).
* Morning: Pitti Palace & Boboli Gardens. Located minutes from Via Romana. The Pitti is a treasure trove of Raphael and Titian. The Boboli Gardens in winter are melancholic and grand, with statues silhouetted against grey skies. Access via the Annalena entrance on Via Romana is convenient.
* Lunch: Enoteca Pitti Gola e Cantina (Piazza Pitti 16). Directly across from the palace. A serious wine destination. Book a tasting lunch.
* Afternoon: Explore the Santo Spirito Market (often held on the second Sunday of the month). It’s a mix of vintage clothes, antiques, and local crafts.
* Evening: Aperitivo in Piazza della Passera, a tiny, jewel-box square hidden near the Pitti Palace. Caffè degli Artigiani or 5 e Cinque are excellent spots.
Monday, Feb 9: The Move & Work Begins
* Morning: Check out of San Pier Novello. Move to Via dell'Orto 31. Check-in is after 3:00 PM, so drop bags if allowed or use storage.
* Culture: Cappella Brancacci (Piazza del Carmine). Located two streets from your new apartment. This is the "Sistine Chapel of the Early Renaissance," famous for Masaccio’s frescoes. Note: Access is strictly controlled. Booking is mandatory and visits are often limited to 30 minutes. Mondays are one of the opening days (10:00-17:00).
* Lunch: I' Brindellone. Your first proper Florentine steak lunch.
* Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
* Late Dinner: Il Guscio (Via dell'Orto 49). A refined restaurant on your street. Excellent pasta and sophisticated atmosphere.
Tuesday, Feb 10: The Uffizi Strategy
* Morning: Uffizi Gallery. Closed Mondays, so Tuesday is a prime day. Book the 8:30 AM slot to beat the crowds. Focus on the Renaissance heavyweights: Botticelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo.
* Lunch: Avoid the All'Antico Vinaio queue. Go to 'Ino (Via dei Georgofili) for a gourmet panino that is arguably superior and more civilized.
* Afternoon: Cross the Ponte Vecchio. Stop at Santa Felicita to see Pontormo’s Deposition, a shocking masterpiece of Mannerist color, visible for free immediately upon entering the church.
* Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
* Late Dinner: Osteria Santo Spirito.
Wednesday, Feb 11: Scientific Florence & Views
* Morning: Museo Galileo. Situated on the Arno, this museum houses the Medici scientific instruments, including Galileo’s own telescopes and gruesome wax anatomical models. It provides a different perspective on the Renaissance—science alongside art.
* Lunch: S. Forno (Via Santa Monaca). A chic bakery in San Frediano. Grab a slice of focaccia or a salad in a beautiful, historic setting.
* Afternoon: Walk up to Piazzale Michelangelo via the Rampe del Poggi (San Niccolò). The climb is steep but the view is the definitive image of Florence. Continue up to San Miniato al Monte, a Romanesque basilica that is older and more mystical than the Duomo.
* Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
* Late Dinner: Tamerò (Piazza Santo Spirito). Fresh pasta bar in a former mechanic's workshop.
Thursday, Feb 12: Viareggio Carnival (Night Parade)
* Event: Viareggio Carnival - 3rd Evening Parade.
* Logistics: The parade is scheduled for Thursday, Feb 12 at 5:00 PM.
* Conflict: This conflicts directly with your work schedule (5-10 PM).
* Adjustment: Unless you can shift your work hours this day, you cannot attend. Assuming work is fixed, stay in Florence.
* Alternative Florence Plan:
   * Morning: Officina Profumo-Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella. The oldest pharmacy in the world. The interiors are frescoed and smell of rose water and potpourri. Free to enter and browse.
   * Lunch: Trattoria Sabatino. Experience the €5 pasta and communal vibes.
   * Afternoon: Explore the San Frediano artisan workshops. Visit the Antico Setificio Fiorentino (silk factory) if you can book a tour, or simply wander Via San Frediano.
   * Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
Friday, Feb 13: Michelangelo & Markets
* Morning: Accademia Gallery. The home of The David. Pre-book. The statue is larger and more overwhelming than photographs suggest. The surrounding Hall of Prisoners, with Michelangelo’s unfinished statues, is equally moving.
* Lunch: Mercato Centrale (San Lorenzo). The ground floor is a traditional market (butchers, fishmongers). The upper floor is a gourmet food court. It is touristy but high quality. Try the truffle pasta or a Chianina burger.
* Afternoon: Relax at La Ménagère (Via de' Ginori). A concept store/flower shop/cafe. Beautiful aesthetic, good coffee, but pricey.
* Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
* Dinner: Cammillo (Borgo San Jacopo). A historic trattoria beloved by fashion designers and locals. Higher price point, exceptional quality fried vegetables and curried prawns (a signature eccentricity).
Saturday, Feb 14: Valentine’s Day
* Context: No Viareggio parade today. It is a romantic holiday.
* Day Trip: Arezzo.
   * Train: Direct regional train (~1 hour).
   * Why: Arezzo is a jewel of a medieval city, less crowded than Siena. It is the setting of the film Life is Beautiful.
   * Sights: Piazza Grande (sloping piazza), Basilica of San Francesco (Piero della Francesca’s Legend of the True Cross frescoes—booking mandatory).
   * Lunch: Ristorante Logge Vasari on Piazza Grande.
* Evening: Return to Florence. Romantic dinner at Il Santo Bevitore (Book weeks in advance).
Sunday, Feb 15: Viareggio Carnival (Sunday Parade)
* Event: 4th Masquerade Parade at Viareggio.
* Time: Starts at 3:00 PM. This fits perfectly as it is a Sunday (no work).
* Logistics: * Train: Florence SMN to Viareggio. Regional trains run frequently (approx. 1h 40m). Depart around 10:30 AM.
   * Lunch in Viareggio: Seafood is king here. Try a frittura mista (fried seafood) at a street stand or a sit-down meal at Trattoria da Miro near the port.
   * The Parade: The floats are massive, often 20 meters high, moving through the Art Nouveau seaside promenade. It is political, satirical, and loud.
   * Return: Train back to Florence in the evening. Expect trains to be crowded with returning revelers.
6. Week 2: Deep Dives & Day Trips (Feb 16 – Feb 22)
Theme: Going Deeper into Tuscany
Monday, Feb 16: The Monk’s Cells
* Morning: Museo di San Marco. Located north of the Duomo. This former Dominican convent features frescoes by Fra Angelico in each monk's cell. It is a place of profound quiet and beauty. Open Mondays.
* Lunch: Trattoria Mario (Via Rosina). Near San Marco. Open only for lunch. No reservations, shared tables, bustling. The menu is handwritten. Eat the bistecca or the daily special.
* Afternoon: Grocery run at S. Forno bakery for bread and Pegna (near the Duomo) for specialty items.
* Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
* Late Dinner: Mad Souls and Spirits. Best cocktails in town, dive bar vibe, snacks available (burgers, nachos).
Tuesday, Feb 17: Mardi Gras (Martedì Grasso)
* Event: Viareggio Parade at 3:00 PM.
* Conflict: You work at 5:00 PM. You cannot attend the parade in Viareggio.
* Alternative: Celebrate Mardi Gras in Florence. Eat Schiacciata alla Fiorentina (a vanilla/orange scented sponge cake, typical of Carnival) from Pasticceria Giorgio or S. Forno.
* Morning: Bargello Museum. A fortress-prison turned sculpture museum. Houses Donatello’s David and masterpieces by Michelangelo and Cellini.
* Lunch: Vini e Vecchi Sapori (Via dei Magazzini). Tiny place, hand-written menu. Famous for pappardelle anatra (duck). Booking essential.
* Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
* Dinner: L’Ov Osteria Vegetariana. Clean eating after the carnival sweets.
Wednesday, Feb 18: Santa Croce & Leather
* Morning: Basilica of Santa Croce. The burial place of Michelangelo, Galileo, and Machiavelli. It features Giotto frescoes.
* Lunch: Ditta Artigianale (Via dei Neri location). Good for a quick, high-quality lunch near Santa Croce.
* Afternoon: Scuola del Cuoio (School of Leather). Located inside the Santa Croce complex (access via Via San Giuseppe). You can watch artisans gilding leather. It’s expensive but the quality is unmatched.
* Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
* Dinner: Rasputin. A secret speakeasy in Santo Spirito. You need to book to get the location. A sophisticated way to end the workday.
Thursday, Feb 19: Villa Bardini
* Morning: Villa Bardini. Walk up the hill in Oltrarno. The villa often hosts excellent exhibitions, and the gardens offer one of the best (and quietest) views of Florence.
* Lunch: San Niccolò area. Il Rifrullo or Beppa Fioraia (Via dell'Erta Canina) - a beautiful spot with a garden, great for lunch.
* Afternoon: Walk back along the ancient walls.
* Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
* Dinner: Gune San Frediano. A mix of Lucanian and Tuscan cuisine. A bit more upscale and creative.

* Lunch: Trattoria dell'Orto (one last time for lunch).
* Afternoon: Final prep for the "vacation week."
* Work: 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM.
* Dinner: Essenziale. Modern Tuscan tasting menu. A celebratory start to your week off.
Saturday, Feb 21: Viareggio Closing & Fireworks
* Event: 6th Closing Parade at Viareggio.
* Time: 5:00 PM start.
* Plan:
   * Morning train to Viareggio.
   * Lunch at L’Orsa Minore (seafood) on the beach.
   * Watch the final parade at twilight. The floats light up (which they don't do in day parades).
   * Fireworks display closes the Carnival.
   * Return: Late train to Florence.
Sunday, Feb 22: Bologna Day Trip
* Destination: Bologna (The Fat, The Red, The Learned).
* Transport: High-Speed Train (Frecciarossa/Italo). Takes 38 minutes. Do not take the regional train (takes 1.5-2 hours).
* Itinerary:
   * Morning: Piazza Maggiore. Visit San Petronio.
   * Food: Explore the Quadrilatero food market streets. Buy Mortadella at Simoni.
   * Lunch: Trattoria di Via Serra (needs booking weeks in advance) or Osteria dell'Orsa (traditional, queue heavy). Dish to eat: Tagliatelle al Ragù (Bolognese) or Tortellini in Brodo.
   * Afternoon: Climb the Asinelli Tower (booking required). Walk to San Luca if you are energetic (porticoed walk up a hill).
   * Return: Train to Florence.
7. Week 3: The Vacation Week (Feb 23 – Feb 27)
Theme: Full Days, Further Afield
Monday, Feb 23: Siena
* Transport: Bus (Autolinee Toscane - Line 131R - Rapida).
   * Reasoning: The train station in Siena is at the bottom of the hill, far from the center. The bus drops you at Piazza Gramsci, right in the historic center.
   * Duration: 1h 15m. Depart from the bus station near Florence SMN (Via Santa Caterina da Siena).
* Itinerary:
   * Piazza del Campo: The shell-shaped brick square.
   * Duomo di Siena: The interior is arguably more spectacular than Florence’s, with intricate mosaic floors and the Piccolomini Library (frescoes by Pinturicchio).
   * Museo dell'Opera del Duomo: Climb the Facciatone for the panoramic view of Siena.
* Lunch: La Taverna di San Giuseppe. Located in an Etruscan cellar. Famous for gnocchi and wild boar.
* Return: Bus back to Florence in the late afternoon.
Tuesday, Feb 24: Pisa & Lucca
* Transport: Regional Train. Route: Florence -> Pisa -> Lucca -> Florence.
* Morning: Pisa.
   * Train Florence to Pisa San Rossore (if possible) or Pisa Centrale. San Rossore is a 5-min walk to the Tower.
   * Campo dei Miracoli: See the Leaning Tower, Duomo, and Baptistery. You only need 2-3 hours here.
* Lunch: Move to Lucca (30 min train). Lucca is more charming for dining. Eat at Buca di Sant'Antonio.
* Afternoon: Lucca.
   * The Walls: Rent a bike and cycle the 4km loop atop the intact Renaissance walls.
   * Piazza dell'Anfiteatro: An oval piazza built on Roman ruins.
   * Guinigi Tower: The tower with oak trees on top.
* Return: Train Lucca to Florence (~1h 20m).
Wednesday, Feb 25: Chianti Wine Tour
* Logistics: Since you don't have a car, a small group tour is best. Public bus schedules to wineries are sporadic and limiting.
* Activity: Half-day or Full-day Chianti Tour. Look for tours visiting Greve in Chianti or Panzano.
   * Recommendation: A tour that includes lunch at Dario Cecchini (the famous butcher of Panzano) is a bucket-list experience for carnivores.
   * Wine: Focus on Chianti Classico (Black Rooster label). Visit wineries like Castello di Verrazzano or Vignamaggio.
* Evening: Easy dinner in Florence. Gusta Pizza or leftovers.
Thursday, Feb 26: Cinque Terre (Weather Permitting)
* Warning: February is deep off-season. Ferries are suspended. Hiking trails may be closed due to mud. Most shops in the villages are closed.
* Assessment: Check the weather 24 hours prior. If it is raining, do not go. The charm of Cinque Terre is the outdoors.
* If Sunny:
   * Train: Florence -> La Spezia Centrale -> Cinque Terre Express.
   * Visit Manarola and Vernazza (the most picturesque). Walk the harbor. Eat pesto (Liguria is the home of pesto).
   * Do not expect to hike the Azure Trail (likely closed).
* Plan B (Bad Weather): Arezzo (if not visited yet) or a deep dive into Palazzo Vecchio in Florence (Secret Passages Tour).
Friday, Feb 27: Departure
* Morning: Last coffee at Ditta. Buy souvenirs (leather gloves from Madova near Ponte Vecchio, paper from Il Torchio on Via dei Bardi).
* Lunch: Final feast at Trattoria dell'Orto.
* Logistics: Checkout is typically 10:00 AM. Head to airport or train station.
8. Dining Guide: The Oltrarno Selection
Lunch (Pranzo)
* Trattoria dell'Orto: (Via dell'Orto 35) Authentic, neighborhood staple.
* Trattoria Sabatino: (Via Pisana 2) The best value in Florence. Historic, simple, communal.
* I' Brindellone: (Piazza Piattellina) The steak destination for locals.
* S. Forno: (Via Santa Monaca) Chic bakery for light lunches (focaccia, salads).
* Ino: (Via dei Georgofili - near Uffizi) Best gourmet panini.
Dinner (Cena) - Late Night Friendly
* Osteria Santo Spirito: (Piazza Santo Spirito) Open late, lively, truffle gnocchi.
* Il Santo Bevitore: (Via Santo Spirito) Upscale, romantic, booking essential.
* Il Santino: (Via Santo Spirito) Wine bar, small plates, perfect for light late dinners.
* Berberè: (San Frediano) Sourdough pizza, craft beer, youthful vibe.
* Mad Souls & Spirits: (San Frediano) Cocktails and snacks, open very late.

10. Practical "Digital Nomad" Tips for Florence
1. Coperto: Every restaurant charges a €2-3 cover fee per person. It is standard (covers bread/service). Tipping is not mandatory; rounding up is sufficient.
2. Bread: Tuscan bread is saltless (pane sciocco). It is designed to be eaten with salty meats or salty soups/sauces. Do not complain it has no flavor; it is intentional history (from a salt tax war with Pisa).
3. Tickets: Always buy museum tickets from the official B-Ticket website (b-ticket.com/b-ticket/uffizi/) to avoid agency markups.
4. Weather: Florence in February is damp and cold (avg high 12°C, low 3°C). Stone buildings hold the cold. Bring warm slippers for the Airbnb; Italian heating regulations often limit indoor temperatures.
5. Grocery:
   * Esselunga: Large supermarkets (Via Pisana).
   * Conad: Smaller city markets (Via Santa Monaca).
   * Mercato di Santo Spirito: Fresh produce every morning (Mon-Sat). Buying veggies here makes you a local.
