## Optional guided option (time-permitting): Colosseum guided tour or "Full Experience"

Official "Full Experience" options include Arena and/or Underground access. These options have timed entry, a 90-minute limit in the Colosseum, and last access at 3:00 PM. Some tickets are valid for two days. The Full Experience Arena ticket goes on sale seven days before the visit date.

Booking notes:
- Only add a guided or Full Experience option if it still fits the train schedule and keeps the day flexible.
- Book on the official Colosseum ticketing site.

Decision guidance:
- If you want the most flexibility, book the standard Colosseum ticket and add Forum/Palatine on the same ticket.
- If you want Arena/Underground access and can commit to a specific time, choose a Full Experience or guided option and align trains around the time slot.
