Transport is typically included in the tour price. Confirm this before booking.

Notes:
- If the operator includes transport, use the listed meeting point and arrive early.
- For Fun in Tuscany tours, the meeting point is Via Curtatone 9 (outside Cafe Gamberini).
- If the operator offers transport as an option (for example, "round-trip transfer"), select it.
- If no transport is included, do not book that tour unless you are willing to arrange a separate driver.
