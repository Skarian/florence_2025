## Selection notes
- Prioritize tours that clearly include round-trip transport from Florence.
- Confirm meeting point and end time before booking to avoid late returns.

## Recommendation (based on flexibility and pacing)
- Best small-group default: Option A (Chianti Wine Tour). Later start, standard length, and straightforward booking.
- Best small-group lunch experience: Option B (Chianti Classico). Earlier start with a 3-course lunch, still returns by 5:00 PM.
- Best private option: Option C (Tuscanique). Private, customizable, includes lunch and more wineries, but requires direct booking and optional transfer selection.
