# Day Trips TODO (Not Yet Booked)

This file tracks day-trip planning and booking. It is anchored to `docs/trip_facts.md` and uses `docs/initial_plan.txt` only as an ideas pool (not a plan).

Formatting notes:
- Keep day-trip items themselves in "Priority 1".
- Put all activities (including timed-entry items like the Colosseum) in "Priority 3".
- Keep transport-only notes in "Priority 2".
- Avoid nesting activities under the day-trip bullets to keep the file clean.

Status key: TBD | shortlisted | booked | dropped

## Priority 1: Day trips to decide and book

- Week 1 weekend day trip — Sat Feb 14, 2026 (destination Rome) (status: TBD)
- Week 2 weekend day trip — Sat Feb 21, 2026 (destination Venice) (status: TBD)
- Week 3 weekday day trip #1 — Tue Feb 24, 2026 (Tuscany/Chianti wine tour; operator TBD) (status: TBD)
- Week 3 weekday day trip #2 — Thu Feb 26, 2026 (open-ended destination; planned later by wife, out of scope except date) (status: TBD)

## Priority 2: Transport for day trips

- Florence ↔ Rome high-speed train tickets (for Week 1 weekend day trip) (status: TBD)
- Florence ↔ Venice high-speed train tickets (for Week 2 weekend day trip) (status: TBD)
- Other regional train/bus tickets once Week 3 open-ended day trip is chosen (status: TBD)
- Transportation not required for Tuscany/Chianti as wine tour typically includes transportation; update if untrue.

## Priority 3: Activities tied to day trips

- Venice gondola ride (wife wants to ride a gondola) (status: TBD)
- Rome Colosseum visit (timed-entry) (status: TBD)
- Timed-entry attractions for Rome/Venice/Week 3 trips if you choose must-dos (status: TBD)

Note: The Tuscany/Chianti wine tour is itself the primary activity and usually includes transport or a defined meeting point. Once an operator is chosen, confirm what is included.

## Ideas pool (optional, not booked)

- Day trip ideas: Rome, Venice, Bologna, Siena, Pisa+Lucca, Viareggio Carnival, Cinque Terre
